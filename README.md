## üéØ Project Goal

The core objective was to design an intuitive and efficient user experience where voice commands are a primary (or significant) mode of interaction. This project explores how users can navigate, input data, and control the application using spoken language.

## üó£Ô∏è Key Voice Interaction Features Designed

*   **Voice Activation Trigger:** How the app starts listening (e.g., wake word, button press).
*   **Core Voice Commands:** For key app functionalities like:
    *   `"Navigate to [Screen/Section]"`
    *   `"Search for [Item]"`
    *   `"Play [Song/Video]"`
    *   `"Add [Item] to [List]"`
    *   `"Set reminder for [Task] at [Time]"`
    *   *(List specific commands relevant to your app)*
*   **Visual Feedback for Voice Input:**
    *   Listening state (e.g., microphone icon animation, visualizer).
    *   Processing state (e.g., loading indicator).
    *   Spoken text transcription.
    *   Confirmation of successful command execution.
*   **Error Handling & Disambiguation:**
    *   Prompts for when a command isn't understood.
    *   Suggestions for similar commands.
    *   Clarification questions if input is ambiguous.
*   **Onboarding for Voice Features:** How users learn about and enable voice control.
*   **Touch Fallbacks/Hybrid Interaction:** How touch interaction complements or serves as an alternative to voice.

*(Adjust this list based on the specific voice features you designed.)*

## üìÑ Repository Contents

*   **`/figma-link.md`**: (Optional) A simple file with the direct link to the Figma design.
*   **`/voice-flow-diagrams`**: (Optional) Diagrams illustrating conversation flows, user intents, and system responses.
*   **`/sample-scripts`**: (Optional) Example voice command scripts or user stories.
*   **`/exported-screens`**: (Optional) Static exports (PNG/JPG) of key UI states related to voice interaction.
*   **`/prototype-videos`**: (Optional) Screen recordings demonstrating the voice interaction flow (since Figma prototypes might not fully simulate voice).

*(Customize this section based on what your repository actually contains.)*

## üé® Design Approach & Considerations

*   **Natural Language Focus:** Aimed for conversational and intuitive command structures.
*   **Discoverability:** How users learn what they can say.
*   **Efficiency:** Making tasks faster or easier with voice compared to touch.
*   **Minimizing Cognitive Load:** Clear feedback and simple interactions.
*   **Accessibility:** Voice control as an assistive technology.
*   **Context Awareness:** (If applicable) How the app uses context to better understand commands.

## üíª Tech Stack (Conceptual or for Handoff)

*   **Design Tool:** Figma
*   **Prototyping:** Figma, (mention other tools if used, e.g., Voiceflow, Adobe XD for voice, screen recording software)
*   **(Conceptual - if thinking about implementation):**
    *   **Voice Recognition API:** [e.g., Web Speech API, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe]
    *   **NLP Platform:** [e.g., Dialogflow, Amazon Lex, Rasa]

## üöÄ Status

*   **Design Phase:** [e.g., Concept Exploration, High-Fidelity Prototyping, User Testing Phase, Ready for Development]
*   **Last Figma Update:** [Date or "See Figma Version History"]

## ü§ù How to Use / Feedback

*   **For Design Review:** Please use the commenting features directly within the [Figma File](#figma-design-file). Pay close attention to the user flows demonstrating voice interactions.
*   **For Understanding Voice Logic:** Review any flow diagrams or sample scripts in this repository.
*   **Questions/Suggestions:** Contact [Your Name/Email] or open an [Issue](link_to_issues_if_you_use_them) in this repository.
